I really want to get this game into as many hands as possible but I don't want to take out ads. So far I've only shared it with my friends and family and put it on my social media.

We are looking at consistantly 40 unique visitors for the last 2 days. About 30 games per day so far. As far as I can tell that number is going up. Not by much, but given that I haven't shared it other than the initial day, that means that people are sharing it with friends.

I am also tracking who is clicking the share button which is 10 today. I only had about 5 people send it to me which means that people are sharing it with other people which is great.

I had a friend share it with another friend who it looks like posted it on their twitter so I've been getting hits from that.

I've tried to optomize the experience to make sharing as easy as possible. The link automatically copies the sharebale text. The shareable text includes the game number, the tiles flipped, the score and whether or not you are in hard mode. Someone in my family suggested to change the tiles based on hard mode or easy mode and that was a great change, we'll see if people like it.

I feel like the more fun I make the game and the easier it is to play, the more people will share it.

We'll see what happens, it's just a matter of time. However, I do expect it to grow pretty naturally.

My prediction is that by this time next week, we'll have at least 100 daily active users.
