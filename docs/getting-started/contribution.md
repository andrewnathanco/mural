# Contribution

As of now I have no plans to document a full contribution guide. If you want to contribute open an issue titled `[CONTR]: Contribution request` and we can directly work one on one for onboarding.

If you notice a bug or have a feature request open an issue titles `[BUG]: Whatever the bug is` or `[FEAT]: Whatever the feature is`. Please look through and see if you can find the bug first. I'm pretty good about identifying and squashing them but give me a day or so.
