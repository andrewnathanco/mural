# Technical Stack

The application is built using the following stack.

| Domain           | Language/Framework      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Presentation     | HTML/HTMX/Tailwind      |
| Templating       | Golang Native Templates |
| State Management | Server Site             |
| Backend          | Echo Framework          |
| Database         | SQLite3                 |
| Deployment       | Github Actions          |
| Server           | Digital Ocean Droplet   |
| Analytics        | Managed Plausible       |

I chose HTMX / Golang / SQLite3 partially because of the speend of devemopment and speed of the site but mainly because I wanted to try out HTMX. What I found when doing it however was that the developer experience was amazing. Highly recommend to anyone using Golang.
